This is the project that i've made on the basic principle of cryptography.

Using buffer it store the data in memory.It then reads the file data.

Then it will be encrypt the file data using XOR encryption.

It will also Output files in "encrypted data". These files can now be able to read to few/targeted user only.

When the Crypted file is run, it will simply decrypts the data using system memory.

At last, file will then executed from System memory.
